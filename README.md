#React Assessment

React has been used to copy the front-end. Images were screenshotted from the provided picture and used in the website.
 All the "must-have" sections has been achieved :
● Use React for the front end framework
● Use the listed style guide below for colors and fonts to supplement the
front end design
● Be able to click between at least two (2x) weeks to pull fresh data that is
relevant to the displayed date

The code is pretty simple and self-explanatory. I have used approach to make the app as simple as possible. With addition of more features, this app can be made more bulky and the code more complex.
I made my own json data. I can use an express backend server on NodeJs but considering the time, I chose to go with a simple json data inside the src folder.

In a real world scenario, I can make this app better. Tickets can be added in JIRA or other project management tools to work on the features one by one. Few features I can think of are making buttons work, give toast message on applying shifts, make log-in log-out features, etc.

The project was an awesome exercise.
